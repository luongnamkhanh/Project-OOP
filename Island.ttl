The volcanism relates to a still ongoing regimen of crustal extension. Argon-argon dating has yielded ages of 800,000 years to 0 on olivine tholeiite; a recent eruption was recorded in 1923 which formed land that was later removed again by the sea. A past eruption in 608 AD might be recorded in the chronicles of the Sui dynasty, while future eruptions could cause tsunamis."@en .

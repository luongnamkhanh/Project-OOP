The park borders the Hin Namno National Park in Khammouane Province, Laos to the west and 42 km east of the South China Sea from its borderline point. Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng National Park is in a limestone zone of 2,000 km2 in Vietnamese territory and borders another limestone zone of 2,000 km2 of Hin Namno in Laotian territory. The core zone of this national park covers 857.54 km2 and a buffer zone of 1,954 km2. The park was created to protect one of the world's two largest karst regions with 300 caves and grottoes and also protects the ecosystem of limestone forest of the Annamite Range region in North Central Coast of Vietnam. Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng is noted for its cave and grotto systems as it is composed of 300 caves and grottos. A 2009 survey brought the total discovered length of the cave system to about 126 km, with many areas still not well explored. Sơn Đoòng Cave, which was discovered in the 2009 survey by British and Vietnamese explorers, is considered the largest cave in the world. Even before this discovery, Phong Nha held several world cave records, including the longest river as well as the largest combined caverns and passageways. The park derives its name from Phong Nha Cave, containing many rock formations, and Kẻ Bàng forest. The plateau on which the park rests is one of the finest and most distinctive examples of a complex karst landform in Southeast Asia. This national park was listed in UNESCO's World Heritage Sites in 2003 for its geological values as defined in its criteria viii. In April 2009, the world's largest cave, was re-discovered by a team of British cave explorers of the British Caving Association led by a local farmer named Ho Khanh."@en ;

Normally, the national parks located in the territory of multiple provinces and cities are managed by the Ministry of Agriculture and Rural Development, while the national parks located within the boundary of a province or city are managed by the People's Committee of the province or of the city. The national parks in Vietnam, stretching from the Northern borders to the Southern remote islands, are set up in order to protect the natural ecosystems, flora and fauna, diverse natural landscapes, such as the subtropical rain forests, in Phia Oắc-Phia Đén, the sub-alpine subtropical forests, the evergreen tropical forests to the coastal mangrove forests of Xuân Thủy, Cát Bà, and Mũi Cà Mau, and the melaleuca forests on peat in U Minh Thượng and U Minh Hạ. Currently, Vietnam has 34 national parks. Cúc Phương is the first national park and was established in 1966 in the area of 3 provinces: Ninh Bình, Thanh Hóa and Hòa Bình. Meanwhile, the latest national park established is Song Thanh (Sông Thanh), setup on December 18, 2020, located in Quảng Nam province. Phong Nha-Kẻ Bàng is the national park with the largest area, while the mangrove forests in Xuân Thủy National Park are the national park with the smallest area.

        dbo:abstract  "Vĩnh Tràng Chùa is a Buddhist temple near Mỹ Tho in the Mekong Delta region of southern Vietnam. It is one of the best-known temples in the region. The temple stands on a 2-hectare (4.9-acre) block filled with fruit trees in the village of Mỹ Hóa in the town of Mỹ Phong, on the banks of the Bảo Định canal. In the middle of the 19th century, the temple came into being through the endeavours of the district chief Bùi Công Đạt, who organised its erection. He recruited the monk Thích Từ Lâm from Bửu Lâm Temple to preside over Vĩnh Tràng. Following the death of Bùi Công Đạt, Thích Huệ Đăng presided over the remainder of the construction phase and the temple was completed in 1850. Between 1859 and 1862, French colonial forces battled the army of the Nguyễn Dynasty of Emperor Tự Đức. The French army prevailed and Tự Đức ceded three southern provinces to become the colony of Cochinchina. In the fighting, Vĩnh Tràng was seriously damaged. The successor of Thích Huệ Đăng was Thích Thiện Đề, and he oversaw the reconstruction efforts. After his death, the temple fell into disuse. In 1890, Thích Trà Chánh was recruited from Sắc tứ Linh Thứu Temple to become the abbot of the temple. The new abbot hailed from Mỹ Tho and was a disciple of Thích Minh Phước. In 1895, Thích Chánh Hậu organised a complete renovation of the temple. In 1904, the temple was ravaged in a large tropical storm, requiring a major rebuilding in 1907. Thích Chánh Hậu presided as the abbot for 33 years until his death in 1923. His successor Thích Minh Đàn, organised further renovations including the main triple gate, main ceremonial hall and the patriarch hall. The main triple gate was built in 1933 through the labour of craftsmen recruited from the imperial capital in Huế, central Vietnam. The central gate is made from steel, while the two side gates are made from concrete and styled akin to a historical fortress. The triple gate has an upper level with another large gate on top. On the right is the statue of Thích Chánh Hậu and on the left is a statue of Thích Minh Đàn. Both sculptures were made of statue and were made by Nguyễn Phi Hoanh. The front of the temple is designed in a style that mixes European and Asian architecture. In the main hall of the temple, there are multiple statues of various Buddhas including Amitabha Buddha, Gautama Buddha, various arahants and bodhisattvas. There are also statues of Thích Chánh Hậu and Thích Minh Đàn. The three oldest statues in the temple are those of Amitabha, Avalokiteshvara and Đại Thế Chí bodhisattva, which are made of bronze. However, the statue of Avalokiteshvara has been lost for a long time, so a wooden replacement was made. There is also a statue of the Jade Emperor, roughly the size of a real human. The statues of 18 arahants are carved from wood and were made in 1907 by a group of southern craftsmen. Each statue is approximately 80 centimetres (31 in) tall and 58 centimetres (23 in) in width. The garden of the temple is decorated with many pot plants and are tended to on a regular basis. Under the shade of one tree is the stupa of Thích Chánh Hậu, in which his ashes are interred.

In the main hall is a banner, containing a verse of praise of the temple and its founder, written by Nguyễn Phúc Chu, one of the Nguyễn lords who once ruled central and southern Vietnam and the city of Huế. The temple is situated on a small hill in the ward of Trường An in the city of Huế. It is located about 2 kilometres (1.2 mi) from the Phú Cam bridge that spans the Perfume River, which passes through Huế. The temple was founded by Zen Master Thích Nguyên Thiều (1648–1728), between 1682 and 1685, and was known as the Vĩnh Ân Temple. Thích Nguyên Thiều was originally from China, and was a disciple of Thích Khoáng Viên, from Guangdong in southern China. In 1677, he immigrated to southern Vietnam by boat, to settle in territory ruled by the Nguyễn Lords. He had initially arrived in Bình Định further south, founding the Chùa Thập Tháp Di-đà (Vietnamese for Temple of the Ten Towers of Amitabha). After building his first temple, he travelled the region expounding the dharma, before travelling to Huế to found the Hà Trung Temple in Vinh Hà district before moving to the Ngự Bình mountain district to build the Vĩnh Ân Temple. In 1689, the Nguyễn Lord had the name of the temple changed to the Quốc Ân Temple, and gave the temple an exemption from the land taxation system. Chùa Quốc Ân is the seat of a Buddhist patriarch lineage of central Vietnam, since Zen Master Thích Nguyên Thiều was the 33rd patriarch of the Lâm Tế Zen School. Today, the bulk of Buddhists in central and southern Vietnam are believed to have taken refuge under Thích Nguyên Thiều's lineage of disciples and students. After the passing of Thích Nguyên Thiều, the ruling Nguyễn Lord of the time, Nguyễn Phúc Chu posthumously conferred him with imperial titles. During the time of the Nguyễn Dynasty, which was founded in 1802 and was derived from the Nguyễn Lords, the temple was renovated many times. In 1805 , the elder sister of Emperor Gia Long personally funded a renovation project. At the time, the temple was a modest and simple. In 1822, the temple was the subject of another imperial funded renovation project, this time funded by Gia Long's son and successor, Emperor Minh Mạng. In 1825, the abbot died and a stupa was built in the garden of the temple, in which his remains were interred. The temple was the subject of another phase of expansion and renovation between 1837-42. From 1846-63, a triple gate was built, along with further shrines. At the front of the temple complex is the main ceremonial hall, while the patriarch hall is at the rear, while the sangha's quarters are at the sides. The main hall has a shrine commemorating the birth of Prince Siddhartha, who went on to achieve enlightenment as Gautama Buddha. In the front yard of the temple, there is a plaque in 1729 erected by the Nguyễn Lord of the time, Nguyễn Phúc Chu, praising the spiritual achievements of the temple founder, Thích Nguyên Thiều."@en .

On the left of the statues is a stupa, of octagonal stupa, that stands three storeys high for a total of 4 m in height. On the right hand side, in the middle of a green patch of lawn is a pond which is adorned with clear water, flowers and the sight of goldfish swimming. The area is further adorned by other plants. On both sides is a twelve step entrance up into the main ceremonial hall, which is guarded by two statues of dragons, which represent the protection of the dharma, the teachings of Gautama Buddha. The temple is built in a classical Asian style of architecture, and is of a simple layout and model. At the two corners of the temples, are dragon statues, staring at the roof of the temple. There are various quotations displayed in various places in the temple. In the centre of the main ceremonial hall, there is statue of Gautama Buddha, made of bronze, seated on a lotus. The statue weighs 1250 kg. The statues was cast in 1952 and was inaugurated by the Buddhist Patriarch of Vietnam, Thích Tịnh Khiết.

Currently, the office of the Board of the Buddhist Association of Lâm Đồng Province is seated at the temple. Although Linh Son Pagoda lacks the historic nature of other temples in that it was only built in the 20th century, its elegant nature and aesthetic appeal has made it one of the main sights in the tourist resort town of Da Lat. The temple is particular popular among visitors, Buddhists and general tourists alike, particular in the spring. The large bell is reputed to be made from bronze alloyed with gold, that make it too heavy for would be robbers to carry away. The temple also has a variety of tea and coffee plants, which are tended by the sangha. Around 20 monks and around half a dozen novices live at the temple."@en .

        dbo:abstract  "Thích Ca Phật Đài (lit. 'Platform of Shakyamuni Buddha') is a notable Theravada Buddhist temple in the coastal city of Vung Tau in southern Vietnam. It lies to the northwest of the Lớn mountain and was built between 1961 and 1963 when it was opened. It is set on a plot of around five hectares, with a Zen Buddhist monastery at the foot of the plot and the Thích Ca Phật Đài at the top. The Zen monastery is a small brick temple built by a government official from Vung Tau in 1957. In 1961, the Buddhist association organised for a renovation of the monastery and decided to build the Thích Ca Phật Đài further up the mountain. Additional lodgings were built to cater to Buddhist pilgrims who come and visit the site. The temple is reached by taking a left turn from the Bến Đình markets and travelling one kilometre to the foot of the Lớn mountain. This leads to the front of the temple, which is marked by a triple gate held up by four imposing and solid pillars. Past the triple gate, there is a long path of stone steps leading up the hill to the temple. The path overlooks the city down to the South China Sea below. The grounds are dense with foliage, resembling a jungle and heavily populated by birds. Along the path up to the temple, the way is decorated with various statues that depict important events in the life of Gautama Buddha: his birth as Prince Siddhartha, his renunciation of the world, the enlightenment under the bodhi tree at Bodh Gaya, the first sermon at Sarnath and the passing into final Nibbāna at Kusinara. There is also a garden, with plants and flowers blooming all year round, with props and scenery to re-enact the first sermon at Deer Park in Sarnath, where the Buddha explained the Four Noble Truths and the Eightfold Noble Path to the first five sangha and arahants: Kaundinya, Assaji, , and . Further along the path to the temple at the top of the hill, there is a bodhi tree that was brought to Vietnam on November 2, 1960, by the Venerable Narada, an eminent Theravada Buddhist monk from Sri Lanka known for his efforts in spreading the Dhamma. There are an additional six circularly wrapped dragon statues along the path. Behind the dragons are two lions, which represent strength and force. There is a stone paved yard at the top, with an octagonal stupa standing 19 m surrounded by four peaks in each direction. Each of these sites contain soil taken from the four holiest sites of Buddhism in ancient India: Lumbini, the birthplace of Prince Siddhartha, Bodh Gaya, the location of enlightenment, Sarnath, the location of the first sermon and the forest Kusinara where the Buddha entered nirvana. The main statue of Gautama Buddha sitting on a lotus seat stands 10.20 m. The white colour of the statue and the stupa contrast against the blue and green background of the surrounding sky and forest. The site has become a major tourist location in the city as well as a tourist lookout."@en .
